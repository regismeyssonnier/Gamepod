## 1. AI DQN RL

Keywords: AI Deep Q Learning Reinforcement Learning

Put `moveNN` to True to use your DQN trained, or False for training the DQN.

The DQN is saved in a file bestweight_nn.py.pth, you have to load it in the Superpod constructor class.

For **podg_tkdqn16.py**, the model are saved in bestnn.py.pth

See in the code for more info

## 2. AI PPO RL

**podg_tkdqn16PPORL.py** the best way to converge, use this method PPO. It loads the file superpod.zip for example.

You can create your own model, in putting `moveNN` to False, and use this model in putting the same variable to True.
